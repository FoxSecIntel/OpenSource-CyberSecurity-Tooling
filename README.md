# Open Source Tools for Threat Intelligence, Vulnerability Management, and Forensics

As someone working in cybersecurity, I know firsthand the importance of having effective tools for threat intelligence, vulnerability management, and forensics. Fortunately, there are several open source options available that can help organizations address these challenges.

## Threat Intelligence:

| OpenVAS    | This vulnerability assessment tool allows organizations to scan their systems for known vulnerabilities and apply patches to mitigate risks.
 | Shoadan|I often use Shodan to help me identify and understand internet-connected devices and systems. Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices, including servers, routers, cameras, and industrial control systems. It allows you to search for devices using keywords, IP addresses, and other criteria, and provides detailed information about each device, including its IP address, operating system, and open ports||
 |Shodan Browser Extension |  The Shodan browser extension allows users to quickly search for devices using the Shodan database directly from their web browser. When a user visits a webpage, the extension will search the Shodan database for any devices associated with the webpage and display the results in a pop-up window. Invaluable ! |<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shodan/jjalcfnidlmpjhdfepjhjbhnhkbgleap">Shodan Extension</a>|||
| Nmap | As a cybersecurity professional, I frequently use Nmap (Network Mapper) for network scanning and discovery. Nmap is an open source tool that can be run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It works by sending specialized packets to a target system and analyzing the responses to determine the network configuration and open ports. Nmap has a command-line interface as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) called Zenmap, which provides a more user-friendly interface for running scans and analyzing results. It is an essential tool for tasks such as network inventory, identifying open ports on a system, and detecting security vulnerabilities.| |||
| Nessus Essentials:| This popular vulnerability scanner offers a range of features, including patch management and compliance reporting.||||
| Burp Suite Community Edition | A popular toolkit for web application security testing. It includes a range of tools for tasks such as testing web applications for vulnerabilities, intercepting and modifying HTTP traffic, and automating testing processes. Best of all it creates reports and the majority of features are free| |||
| Qualys SSL Server Test|  Qualys SSL Labs is a website that provides a range of tools for testing and analyzing the security of SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) implementations. One of the tools offered by Qualys SSL Labs is the SSL Server Test, which allows users to test the SSL/TLS configuration of a server. Very useful tool in your day to day job| <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Server Test</a>
